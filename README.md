# Assignments

## Circuitpython Hello Circuitpython(and metro and mu)
##### Objective
This assignment taught us the basics of Circuitpython. We made our neopixel red. by assigning RGB values (Links to an external site.) using the fill() function. Then we had to get an led to fade.
# What you had to learn
We learned what RGB values are, and the basic terms for coding since this is a different language that the one we used for arduino. we learned how to change the neopixel red by assigning RGB values (Links to an external site.) using the fill() function. we learned how to name and save assignments. then the code for getting an led to fade was simular to what we knew we just had to get used to the formating, and the lanfguage overall because certain parts were different.

# Circuitpython Servo
##### Objective
to get a servo are to rotate 180 degrees when pressed and only moving when the button is pressed.
##### What you had to learn
What a PWM is and how to use it. The pin process is about the same as what we knew and the code itself, is very similar to the code used last year, it just took some monevering.

# Circuitpython LCD
##### Objective
to get a counter on a LCD to count the amount of presses of a button.
#what you had to learn
Now this project took me forever. getting the counter placement was hard. after reaching 10, it would keep the 0 or it would move over a space and start printing there. It took printing some spaces for the LCD to show the counts.

# Circuitpython Photointerrupters
##### Objective
Wire up your photointerrupter and have it keep track of how many times it has been interrupted.
Your program outputs the count using a full sentence like "The number of interrupts is: ___" or "I have been interrupted ___ times."
The program outputs the sentence every 4 seconds.
Don't use sleep(). 

##### What you had to learn
You had to learn how to make it print the counts in the servo monitor every 4 seconds without time sleep().

# Circuitpython Distance Sensor
##### Objective
to get the neopixel to go through a rainbow when you move your hand over an ultrasonic sensor. for different distances it would go to the different colors in the rainbow.
##### What you had to learn
we had to combine the first assignment with our past knowledge of a servo. we had to use rgb values for the colors and we had ro know what order to put the corresponding numbers for a color to make them go in rainbow order and, for certain colors, blend them.

# Circuitpython classes, objects, and modules
##### Objective
To use a class, object, and module to create a new library designed to make working with RGB LEDs easier.
##### What you had to learn
We had to learn what a class, object and module were, then apply them to an assignment. we had to learn how to wire an RGB and use the different pins that respond to a color light up.

# Hello VS Code
##### Objective
To get vs set up and then for it to print something.
##### What you had to learn
Hw VS works, how it connects to github and putting all of your code into GitHub, then the coding was simple, same as what we did in Circuitpython.

# FancyLED
##### Objective
To use 6 LEDs and for them to show alternating, sparkle, and blinking. We used a class for our main code to import.

##### What you had to learn
This one was quite simple because is was very similar to the rbg assignment. Instead of the colors changing you were just changing the action of the led.
